[Previously](/2023/04/19/overview.html), we gave a rapid overview of **short exact sequences**. In this post, I'll go into more detail about what the things appearing in a short exact sequence actually are.

This post is incomplete! I have a bit more to add.

An **abelian group** is a setting (or "data type") where we can _add_ and _subtract_.

## Numerical examples

The starting examples are

- the real numbers $\R$, e.g. $0, -8.91, 1.5, \sqrt2, \dotsc$ 
- the integers $\Z$, i.e. $\dotsc,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\dotsc$

Here are some non-examples of abelian groups:

- the natural numbers $\N$, i.e. $0,1,2,\dotsc$ (no negatives). This isn't a group because you can't subtract: $2-3$ will "break you out" of $\N$.

- the set of irrational numbers: $\sqrt 2$ and $1-\sqrt 2$ are both irrational, but their sum $\sqrt2 + (1 - \sqrt 2) = 1$ is rational, so addition will "break you out" of irrational numbers.

## Physical examples

Here's a different kind of example.

- Physical displacements in one dimension. We can add and subtract physical displacements like so:
  {% raw %}
  <div>
  \begin{align*}
    {\xra{\hspace{2cm}}} + {\xra{\hspace{4cm}}} &= {\xra{\hspace{6cm}}},\\
    {\xra{\hspace{2cm}}} - {\xra{\hspace{4cm}}} &= {\xleftarrow{\hspace{2cm}}}
  \end{align*}
  </div>
  {% endraw %}
  In a certain sense, this example is just the earlier example $\R$ in disguise. For example, if we measure distances in centimeters, then we can write the above equations as
  {% raw %}
  <div>
  \begin{align*}
    2 + 4 &= 6,\\
    2 - 4 &= -2.
  \end{align*}
  </div>
  {% endraw %}
  (They're coded as 2/4/etc. cm, but will probably appear bigger on your screen.)
  
  But we could also measure distances in inches, in which case we'd instead write
  {% raw %}
  <div>
  \begin{align*}
    {0.78...} + {1.57...} &= {2.36...}\\
    {0.78...} - {1.57...} &= {-0.79...}
  \end{align*}
  </div>
  {% endraw %}

  One reason for the abstract language of abelian groups, rather than just talking about normal addition of numbers, is so that we can describe the _intrinsic_ properties of these examples without making an arbitrary choice of units. It provides "typechecking" that prevents you, for example, from accidentally converting _square_ inches to _square_ centimeters by multiplying by $2.54$ rather than $2.54^2$ (but I won't explain that bit in this post).

- Time durations, such as minutes, hours, days, years. For subtraction, you can interpret 1 hour as "1 hour after", and $-1$ hours as "1 hour before". Again, this is really $\R$ in disguise if we fix a unit of time, but there's no best unit to choose.

<aside class="warning">
  <header>Warning</header>
  <p>Time durations, or "relative times", should not be confused with <em>absolute times</em>, like "12:00am January 1, 1970". It makes sense to add a relative time to an absolute time, e.g.
  \[ (\text{12:00am January 1, 1970}) + (\text{1 day 2 hrs 7 mins}) = \text{2:07am January 2, 1970} \]</p>

  <p>You can also <em>subtract</em> two <em>absolute</em> times to get a <em>relative</em> time, e.g.
  \[ (\text{12:00am January 1, 1970}) - (\text{4:20pm Dec 31, 1969}) = \text{7 hrs 40 mins} \]
  However, it doesn't make sense to <em>add</em> two <em>absolute</em> times, like
  \[ (\text{12:00am January 1, 1970}) + (\text{4:20pm Dec 31, 1969}) = {\red{?????}} \]
  so absolute times are not an abelian group.
  </p>
  
  <p>There's a similar relation between absolute and relative <em>temperatures</em>, or between a circle and angles (described below). It's beyond the scope of this post, but if you're interested, what's going on here is described by another concept called a <dfn><a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/torsors.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">torsor</a></dfn>.</p>
</aside>

"Numerical" examples like $\R$ are "models" of the "in-nature" examples above. This helps explain why we care about $\Z$ on its own rather than only talking about $\R$: we could use the equation
\\[ -3 + 2 = -1 \\]
to say "I loaned him three ducks, he gave me two back, so he still owes me one duck". But an equation like
\\[ 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\]
(he gave me half a duck and another half of a duck, so now I have a whole duck) is nonsensical, assuming the ducks are to be kept alive. That is, many situations are modelled by $\Z$ rather than $\R$.

From the modern point of view, the $1$ living in $\Z$ is _a different mathematical object_ than the $1$ living in $\R$ (the latter can interact with numbers like $0.5$, the former can't). Of course, they "behave exactly the same way"---we encode this using [maps](#maps).

## Wrap-around examples

The next class of examples are where things start to get more interesting. In many situations, we want or need to "throw away" information.

- The <dfn>cyclic group of order $n$</dfn> consists of the numbers $0, 1, ..., n-1$ with "wrap-around addition": we treat $n$ as $0$. It's denoted by $\Z/n\Z$, or just $\Z/n$ if I'm being lazy (which I usually will be), or also $C_n$.

  - in $\Z/4\Z$ we can write
  \\[ 3 + 1 = 4 = 0, \\]
  or
  \\[ 3 = -1. \\]
  (Think of $-1$ as "the thing which when added to $1$ gives $0$", rather than "$1$ with the opposite sign".)
  We could use this equation to describe "three right turns equals one left turn".
  
  - in $\Z/60\Z$, we can write
  \\[ 30 + 45 = 15 \\]
  to talk about minutes elapsed on a clock (ignoring the hours)

  - in $\Z/2\Z$, we can write
  \\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 = 3 = 1 \\]
  to indicate that flipping a switch three or five times has the same effect as flipping it just once. You can think of $\Z/2\Z=\\{0,1\\}$ as consisting of $\\{\text{even}, \text{odd}\\}.$

- <dfn>Angles</dfn> or <dfn>rotations</dfn> form a group denoted by $\T$. If we choose an angular unit and a direction, say degrees and counterclockwise, then we can describe angles using numbers, like
\\[ 90^\circ \text{ or } {-123^\circ} \\]
($-123^\circ$ counterclockwise = $123^\circ$ clockwise). Note that rotating something by $30^\circ$ and then by $40^\circ$ is the same as rotating it by $30+40=70$ degrees, so we can also view $30^\circ$ as "the act of rotating by $30^\circ$" and "addition" in $\T$ as composition (doing one operation and then another).

  But there's a catch: $-360^\circ,0^\circ,360^\circ,720^\circ,$ etc. all correspond to the same angle, as do $10^\circ,370^\circ,730^\circ,\dotsc$ We could also write $\T$ as "$\R/360\Z$".

<aside class="block remark">
  <header>Remark on notation</header>
  <p>
    The reason for using the division symbol is that we're "dividing up" the elements of $\Z$ according to their "distance" from the <dfn>subgroup</dfn> $n\Z$ (= multiples of $n$, displayed in bold):
    \[
      \begin{array}{r|rrr}
               & \bf 6 & 7 & 8\\
               & \bf 3 & 4 & 5\\
               & \bf 0 & 1 & 2\\
            \Z & \bf -3 & -2 & -1\\\hline
        \Z/3\Z & 0 & 1 & 2\\
      \end{array}
    \]
  </p>

  <p>$\T$ stands for "torus": a usual torus (i.e. hollow donut) is $\T^2$ (see below for this notation), so $\T$ is a "one-dimensional torus". There are a gazillion other notations for this group: $\U(1)$, $\SO(2)$, $S^1$ are a few. $\T$ is maybe not the best notation for this post, but it's the one I'm used to from my research.</p>

  <header>Remark</header>
  Unlike times and distances, there <em>is</em> a "best choice of unit" for measuring angles. It is not degrees, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#/media/File:Circle_radians.gif" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">radians</a>. The number of radians in a circle is $\varpi\approx6.2831853\dots,$ so we can write $\T$ as $\R/\varpi\Z$. So this number is very important, and shows up in many places. Due to a historical misstep, many formulas are instead written in terms of $\frac\varpi2\approx3.1415926\dots,$ which is a much less important (though not unimportant) number.

### Multiplication examples

One final example. I've said that abelian groups are a setting where we can "add and subtract". What exactly does that mean

<aside class="block remark">
  <header>Remark</header>
  <p>A <dfn>group</dfn>.</p>
  
  <p>If you like, I have an (ancient af) <a href="https://epiplexis.xyz/a/9ss/group_theory_overview">video about group theory</a>. The symmetry group of a triangle, denoted $D_3$, fits into a short exact sequence
  \[ 0 \to \Z/3 \to D_3 \to \Z/2 \to 0 \]
  where the $\Z/3$ is rotations and the $\Z/2$ indicates whether you flipped it or not.</p>
  
  <p>The full symmetry group of a circle (including both rotations and reflections) is denoted $\mathrm O(2)$, and fits into a short exact sequence
  \[ 0 \to \mathrm{SO}(2) \to \mathrm O(2) \to \Z/2 \to 0 \]
  where again the $\Z/2$ records whether you flipped it or not.

## Maps

**Maps** are how we compare and relate different abelian groups to one another.

If $A$ and $B$ are abelian groups, then a map $f: A \to B$, informally, records "a copy of $A$ (possibly "smeared") living inside $B$". Formally, $f$ must:

- sends each element $a$ of $A$ to an element $f(a)$ of $B$. This is called <dfn>the image of $a$ under $f$</dfn>, which we can also think of as "the incarnation of $a$ inside $B$";
- "preserve the additive structure": every equation between elements of $A$ must remain true when we replace them by their images in $B$. Explicitly, this means
\\[ f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) \\]
for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$.

Examples:

- there's a map $i: \Z \to \R$ which just sends $f(n) = n$.
- {% raw %}<div>\[\xymatrix@R=1em{
    & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
    & 6 & 7 & 8\\
    & 3 & 4 & 5\\
    & 0 & 1 & 2\\
    & -3 & -2 \ar[dd] & -1 \ar[dd]\\
    \Z \ar[d] & \vdots \ar[d] & \vdots \ar[d] & \vdots \ar[d]\\
    \Z/3 & 0 & 1 & 2
  }\]</div>{% endraw %}
- there's a map $f: Z \to Z$ that sends $f(n) = 12n$. This corresponds to the fact that $1 + 2 = 3$ can also be used to say that$1 dozen + 2 dozen = 3 dozen$Beware: the equation $2*3=6$ becomes$2 * 3 dozen = 6 dozen$,_not_$ 2 dozen * 3 dozen = 6 dozen$(which is wrong). It's probably going to be confusing to explain this in a parenthetical. tl;dr there's another concept building on abelian groups called a _ring_; a ring is a setting where you can add, subtract, _and multiply_. The above example is saying that $f$ is a map of abelian groups, but not a map of rings.
- there's a map $f: Z \to Z/4$ which sends
- there's a map $f: Z/3 \to U(1)$ whichs ends
- the map $2^x: R \to (R, *)$ is a map: this comes from the exponential identity $2^(x+y) = 2^x 2^y$.

When we have a map $f: A \to B$, this is recording "an instance of $A$ occurring inside $B$", and we can then use our understanding of one to understand the other. However, this might not be a fully accurate picture of $A$, and it might not see all of $B$.

There are three important sub-types of map:

- a map is **injective** if it never sends two different elements of $A$ to the same element of $B$. That is, it gives an faithful representation of $A$ inside $B$.
- a map is **surjective** if every element of $B$ is the image of some (possibly many) element of $A$. This means that $A$ "sees" all of $B$ (but might get "smeared").
- a map is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective. In this case, $A$ and $B$ are "equal": every problem in $A$ can be converted to a problem in $B$ and vice-versa.

Examples:

    the map Z \to R is injective but not surjective
    the map Z \to Z/4 is surjective but not injective
    the map R \to U(1) is surjective but not injective
    the map 2^x: R \to (R, ) is injective but not surjective. It's bijective if we change this to land in positive numbers instead.

## Short exact sequences

A short exact sequence looks like

0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0

consists of

    three abelian groups $A$, $B$, and $C$
    a map $f: A \to B$ and a map $g: B \to C$

These are required to satisfy the following:

- $f$ is injective ("exactness at $A$")
- $g$ is surjective ("exactness at $C$")
- "exactness at $B$": if $g$ sends two different things in $B$ to the same element of $C$, then those two differ by something in the image of $A$. In symbols, this isif g(x) = g(y), then x - y = f(a) for some a in $A$

(I'll explain exactness in general below.) -->
