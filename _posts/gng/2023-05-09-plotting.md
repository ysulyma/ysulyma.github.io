In this post and [the next](/2023/05/10/maps.html) we'll introduce the idea of *functions* or *maps* between spaces. This is where things start to get more interesting and dynamic. The sequel will dive into the theoretical ideas around functions; in this post, we'll focus more concretely on how to *graph* or *plot* them.

## 2d graphing

If $f\colon\R\to\R$ is a function, its <dfn>graph</dfn> is the set

{% raw %}
<div>
\[ \{(x, f(x)) \mid x \in \R \} \subset \R^2. \]
</div>
{% endraw %}

That is, we plot the input on the horizontal axis and the output on the vertical axis.

A parametric plot involves _two_ functions $g,h\colon\R\to\R;$ in this case, we visualize these using the set

{% raw %}
<div>
\[ \{(g(t), h(t)) \mid t\in \R\} \subset \R^2. \]
</div>
{% endraw %}

Note that the graph of a function is a special case of parametric plotting via

{% raw %}
<div>
\[ g(t) = t, \quad h(t) = f(t). \]
</div>
{% endraw %}

However, on a general parametric plot, it's not possible to read off the input value $t$ which produced a given output value $(x,y).$

### Desmos

[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) is the best 2d graphing calculator on the internet. Here's an example of explicit and parametric plotting in Desmos:

It's also possible to use Desmos programmatically. They provide an API that will embed the calculator directly into your webpage (not an iframe!)

- [Desmos API docs](https://www.desmos.com/api/v1.7/docs/index.html#self-hosting)

- in a TypeScript project, you can install [`@types/desmos`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/desmos)

- [`desmos-react`](https://github.com/ysulyma/desmos-react) provides a React wrapper around the Desmos APIs

Here's an example of using `desmos-react` to embeds Desmos in a video:

### SVG and Canvas

Since this is a series about programming, we want to be able to plot things programmatically, without relying on GUI tools. There are two options for doing so: [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial) and [`<canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). However, plotting functions directly using the APIs (rather than a library) is a bit manual, so I'll show how to do it after we cover linear interpolation (a few posts from now).

Also, for experimenting, using a GUI tool like Desmos is usually faster.

## 3d graphing

There are two kinds of plotting we can do in 3d: curves and surfaces. Curves involve _three_ functions of _one_ variable:

{% raw %}
<div>
\begin{align*}
  x &= f(t)\\
  y &= g(t)\\
  z &= h(t)
\end{align*}
</div>
{% endraw %}

Surfaces involve _three_ functions of _two_ variables:

{% raw %}
<div>
\begin{align*}
  x &= f(u, v)\\
  y &= g(u, v)\\
  z &= h(u, v)
\end{align*}
</div>
{% endraw %}

In 2d, a special kind of parametric curve was the graph of a single function. Similarly, if we have a _single_ function of _two_ variables $f(x, y),$ then we can visualize it using the parametric surface

{% raw %}
<div>
\begin{align*}
  x &= u\\
  y &= v\\
  z &= f(u, v)
\end{align*}
</div>
{% endraw %}

### THREE.js

In this series, we'll use [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/docs/) for all our 3d examples. I'll also (usually) use it in conjunction with [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/), which provides a nice declarative way to use THREE inside React.

We use [`TubeGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TubeGeometry) to plot curves, and [`ParametricGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=parametric#examples/en/geometries/ParametricGeometry) to plot surfaces. Here's a demonstration of using THREE.js to plot the parametric curve

{% raw %}
<div>
\[
  \vcenter{
    \begin{align*}
      x &= 5\cos(4\pi t)\\
      y &= 5\sin(4\pi t)\\
      z &= -3 + 6t
    \end{align*}
  }\qquad 0 \le t \le 1
\]
</div>
{% endraw %}

and the graph of the function

{% raw %}
<div>
\[
  z = \cos(x)\sin(y),\qquad -2\pi \le x,\, y\le 2\pi
\]
</div>
{% endraw %}

### WebGL / WebGPU

THREE.js is a friendly API over [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API). There's also a fancy new thing called [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API). It's probably worth getting familiar with using these technologies directly. If I ever get around to doing so, I'll talk about it in this series.

### Grapher

If you're on OS X, it comes with a great piece of software called Grapher. It can do 2d and 3d graphing, as well as animations; it was hugely important for me when I was learning math growing up. Here's a tutorial video I recorded on how to use it:
