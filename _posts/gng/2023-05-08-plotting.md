In this post and [the next](/2023/05/09/maps.html) we'll introduce the idea of *functions* or *maps* between spaces. This is where things start to get more interesting and dynamic. The sequel will dive into the theoretical ideas around functions; in this post, we'll focus more concretely on how to *graph* or *plot* them.

## 2d graphing

If $f\colon\R\to\R$ is a function, its <dfn>graph</dfn> is the set

{% raw %}
<div>
\[ \{(x, f(x)) \mid x \in \R \} \subset \R^2. \]
</div>
{% endraw %}

That is, we plot the input on the horizontal axis and the output on the vertical axis.

A parametric plot involves _two_ functions $g,h\colon\R\to\R;$ in this case, we visualize these using the set

{% raw %}
<div>
\[ \{(g(t), h(t)) \mid t\in \R\} \subset \R^2. \]
</div>
{% endraw %}

Note that the graph of a function is a special case of parametric plotting via

{% raw %}
<div>
\[ g(t) = t, \quad h(t) = f(t). \]
</div>
{% endraw %}

However, on a general parametric plot, it's not possible to read off the input value $t$ which produced a given output value $(x,y).$

### Desmos

[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) is the best 2d graphing calculator on the internet. Here's an example of explicit and parametric plotting in Desmos:

It's also possible to use Desmos programmatically. They provide an API that will embed the calculator directly into your webpage (not an iframe!)

- [Desmos API docs](https://www.desmos.com/api/v1.7/docs/index.html#self-hosting)

- in a TypeScript project, you can install [`@types/desmos`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/desmos)

- [`desmos-react`](https://github.com/ysulyma/desmos-react) provides a React wrapper around the Desmos APIs

Here's an example of embedding Desmos in a video:

### SVG and Canvas

Since this is a series about programming, we want to be able to plot things programmatically, without relying on GUI tools. There are two options for doing so: SVG and `<canvas>` graphics. 

## 3d graphing
### THREE.js

[THREE.js](https://threejs.org/docs/). [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/).

[`TubeGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TubeGeometry)

[`ParametricGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=parametric#examples/en/geometries/ParametricGeometry)

## Grapher

Grapher is a great piece of software on OS X.
